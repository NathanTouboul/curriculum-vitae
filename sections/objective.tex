\justifying
Graduated with a double masterâ€™s degree in Aerospace Engineering from IIT Chicago and Mechatronics from INSA in France, I gained experience in robotics systems, programming, controls, and more. Following a machine learning internship, I recently completed a research project in the Navigation Laboratory of Illinois Tech on lidar-based localization of autonomous vehicles. Passionate about robotics, space exploration, and computer science, I learn every day to become the best engineer I can be.
