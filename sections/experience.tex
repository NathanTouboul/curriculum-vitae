\subtext{Velo3D \hfill{\small{San Jose, CA}}}
\vspace{1.5ex}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Developed C++ and Python software, to control electronic, pneumatic, and optical systems for metal 3D printers,} involving numerous multi-threaded processes across multiple embedded systems.
    \item \textbf{Implemented a crucial functionality}, accessible through the main UI (QML), enabling customers and manufacturing engineers to effortlessly monitor and override process-critical settings on different servers. 
    This ensures a reliable qualification process for new printers, contributing to the overall system's robustness.
    \item \textbf{Collaborated as a team member in an agile development process using Jira, Git, pull request reviews and CI/CD with Jenkins.} Demonstrated a strong commitment to being a team player throughout the development cycle.
    \item \textbf{Enhanced O\textsubscript{2} correction} using multiple sensors and applying effective filtering techniques, decreasing printer build failure rate.
    \item \textbf{Upgraded the BKM framework of the laser controller firmware} through additional available configurations.
    \item \textbf{Reworked the consistency of powder bed recoating} using asynchronous pneumatic controls.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Designed neural network models to detect anomalies} by analyzing discrepancies in time series data, assessing database quality.
    \item \textbf{Preprocessed the dataset} by creating histograms with variable time frames and applying PCA and K-means clustering as initial analysis.
    \item \textbf{Constructed two ML models} (classification and autoencoder based) using Python with TensorFlow, and Pandas.
\end{itemize}
